## Executive Summary

NexPay Financial engaged in a comprehensive risk assessment across all critical systems. The assessment identified **10 top risks** representing a combined **$75.9M Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)** — nearly 1.9× the company's $40M Series B funding.

**Key findings:**
- 8 of 10 top risks are rated **Critical** (risk score 15–25)
- **4 risks account for 71% of total ALE:** ML model theft, DB privilege escalation, payment key compromise, and PII data breach
- **$150K in security controls** can reduce total ALE by an estimated 72%
- **Current cyber insurance coverage gap:** Standard policies do not cover IP theft ($18.4M ALE from ML model theft)

## Top 5 Risks — Board Summary

### #1 — ML Model Theft ($18.4M ALE)

> **Note:** ML Model Theft appears as #1 in this heatmap but #4 in the FAIR analysis (see 04-risk-assessment-quantitative-fair.md) due to methodological differences in loss distribution modeling.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What's at risk | Proprietary fraud detection ML models — 5 years of training data and research |
| How it happens | Engineer with broad S3 permissions exports model files |
| Why it matters | Our competitive moat disappears — competitors (and fraudsters) replicate detection capability |
| Fix | S3 access logging, file-level ACLs, KMS encryption, DLP monitoring |
| Cost to fix | $5K one-time |
| Timeline | 2 weeks |

### #2 — DB Privilege Escalation ($12.4M ALE)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What's at risk | 1.2M user records including SSNs, bank accounts, and KYC documents |
| How it happens | Over-permissioned DB role exploited by internal actor or compromised engineer |
| Why it matters | GDPR fines (4% of revenue = $12.8M), mandatory breach notification, customer exodus |
| Fix | Row-level security, revoke excessive privileges, just-in-time access |
| Cost to fix | $10K |
| Timeline | 4 weeks |

### #3 — Payment Key Compromise ($12.3M ALE)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What's at risk | All payment signing keys, API credentials, TLS private keys |
| How it happens | Attacker authenticates to Vault without MFA — all keys exposed |
| Why it matters | PCI DSS violation, fraudulent transactions, payment system trust destroyed |
| Fix | MFA on Vault, HSM deployment, path-restricted tokens |
| Cost to fix | $15K |
| Timeline | 2 weeks (MFA), 2 months (HSM) |

### #4 — PII Data Breach via SQL Injection ($11.1M ALE)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What's at risk | Customer PII accessible through public API endpoints |
| How it happens | WAF deployed without SQLi ruleset — standard SQL injection attack succeeds |
| Why it matters | $11M+ in regulatory fines, breach response, and customer churn |
| Fix | Deploy WAF OWASP SQLi ruleset, run DAST scanner |
| Cost to fix | $5K |
| Timeline | 2 weeks |

### #5 — Secrets in Public Repository ($6.0M ALE)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What's at risk | Cloud credentials, API keys, database passwords in source code |
| How it happens | Developer commits credentials to GitHub (accidental) |
| Why it matters | Full production environment exposed — data theft, resource abuse, cryptomining |
| Fix | Secret scanning in CI/CD, enforced pre-commit hooks, credential rotation |
| Cost to fix | $1K |
| Timeline | 1 week |

## Risk Appetite Statement (Proposed)

"NexPay Financial will accept residual risks rated Medium (score 1–9) after cost-effective controls are implemented. Risks rated High (10–14) must have active remediation plans with identified owners. Risks rated Critical (15+) must be remediated or explicitly accepted by the Board with documented rationale. Annual aggregate residual risk exposure shall not exceed $15M in quantified ALE."

## Appendix: Methodology

- **Qualitative assessment:** 5×5 matrix per ISO 31000 / NIST SP 800-30
- **Quantitative assessment:** FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) via OpenFAIR toolkit
- **Threat modeling:** Microsoft STRIDE per critical system
- **Asset valuation:** Replacement cost + data value + IP value
